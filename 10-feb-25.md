##  **Today I Learned: Flow Control & JavaScript Objects**

Today, I explored some essential JavaScript concepts, including flow control challenges and objects. Here's a quick summary of what I learned:

### Flow Control Questions

1. **FizzBuzz** – A popular coding challenge that tests conditions using modulus (`%`) and `if-else `statements.

2. **checkSpeed** – Determines whether a driver is speeding and assigns penalties accordingly.

3. **countTruthy** – Counts the number of truthy values in an array (ignoring `false`, `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`).

### **JavaScript Objects & OOP Concepts**

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – A programming paradigm where objects represent real-world entities.
* **Factory & Constructor Functions** – Two ways to create objects dynamically in JavaScript.
* **Dynamic Nature of Objects** – Objects can be modified at runtime by adding or removing properties.
* **Value vs. Reference** – Primitives (numbers, strings, etc.) are copied by value, while objects are passed by reference.
* **Cloning an Object** – Done using `Object.assign({}, obj)` or the spread operator `{ ...obj }`.
* **Garbage Collection** – JavaScript automatically frees up memory by removing unused objects.

### **Built-in JavaScript Objects**

* **Math Object** – Provides utility functions like `Math.random()`, `Math.floor()`, and `Math.max()`.
* **String Object** – Useful methods include `.toUpperCase()`, `.trim()`, and `.replace()`.
* **Date Object** – Handles date and time operations (`new Date()`).
*** Template Literals **– Use backticks (`Hello, ${name}!`) for cleaner string formatting.

 Today’s learning reinforced the importance of JavaScript fundamentals, and I’m excited to build on this knowledge!
