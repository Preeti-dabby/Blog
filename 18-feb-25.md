### Building a **Tic-Tac-Toe** Game : Day 1 Progress

Today, I started working on a Tic-Tac-Toe game using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. My focus was on setting up the basic structure and styling the game board.

**What I Accomplished Today**

**HTML Structure :**
* Created a 3x3 grid using a simple <div> structure.
* Added unique IDs to each cell for easy manipulation in JavaScript.

**CSS Styling :**
* Styled the board to make it visually appealing.
* Used flexbox to align the cells neatly.
* Applied hover effects for a better user experience.

**JavaScript Logic (Initial Work) :**
* Grabbed all the cells using `document.querySelectorAll()`.
* Started writing the function to handle click events.
* Implemented a basic turn-based system (X and O).

**Next Steps**
* Add game logic to check for a **winner**.
* Display the result when the game ends.
* Implement a reset button.
