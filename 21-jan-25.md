#### **My First Day at Ryaz.io: _A New Beginning_**
Today marked my first day at **Ryaz.io**, and I was both excited and nervous as I stepped into this new chapter of my Life.I was handed my first task: creating a sample portfolio using HTML and CSS based on a design provided in Figma.

The design was clean, modern, and visually appealing. My goal was to translate that static layout into a web page. It was a challenge that excited me, as it allowed me to demonstrate my coding skills right from the start.

I began by carefully analyzing the Figma design, noting the structure, color scheme, typography, and spacing. With a clear plan in mind, I started writing the **HTML** to create the structure and hierarchy of the portfolio. Then, I moved on to **CSS** to style the page, ensuring it matched the _Figma design_.

It was a fulfilling experience to see the design come to life in the browser, transitioning from static artboards to a dynamic web page. By the end of the day, I had a portfolio sample that aligned with the Figma design.

This task not only helped me settle into my new role but also reassured me that I was in the right place to _grow and learn_!
